<p><strong>FleetDB is a schema-free database optimized for agile development.</strong></p>

<p>FleetDB offers a flexible and expressive data model designed for the needs of modern applications. A combination of declarative queries, automatically maintained indexes, and an optimizing query planner make it easy to manipulate and retrieve data. FleetDB keeps all data in RAM as persistent data structures to enable multi-document transactions, excellent concurrency characteristics, and high performance. The database writes to an append-only log to provide durability in a single file that can be transfered and analyzed using standard Unix tools. FleetDB is accessible via a simple JSON-based protocol that is implemented by clients in several programming languages.</p>
